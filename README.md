# SM App Translation Files
This repo includes the StellarMate App translation files. You can edit existing files to translate strings or fix existing translations or add a new language by simply copying the master *en.js* file and saving it as a two-letter language code (e.g. ko.js for Korean).

Once you are finished with the changes, please submit a pull request so that the changes are incorporated into the SM App.
